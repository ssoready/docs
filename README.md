# SSOReady docs

This repo contains the source material for ssoready.com/docs. It also contains the internal API definitions and metadata that are used to generate the SSOReady SDKs:

* https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-typescript
* https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-python

PRs are welcome!

We use a third-party service called [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com) for our documentation. If you would like to contribute, you will likely find [Fern's own docs](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/home) very helpful.
