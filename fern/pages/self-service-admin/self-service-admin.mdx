Every SAML Connection requires that you establish a trust relationship with your customer's IDP. In order to establish such a trust relationship, you will need to exchange information with your customer. Although simple in principle, the process can feel tedious (e.g. follow-up emails, live onboarding meetings).  

We recently added an **optional** feature that simplifies the SAML Connection configuration process. You may grant a customer one-time access to SAML Connections within their own Organization. The customer will not have access to other Organizations.  

Here's how it works.

From any Organization's page in SSOReady, under *Customer self-serve setup*, click *Copy setup link*. This generates a magic link. Anyone who follows this link will automatically log into SSOReady. The link will work **only once.** You will send this link to your customer (e.g. via email or a shared Slack workspace). As with any magic link, please exercise caution. 

Upon following the link, the customer may:
    - See any existing SAML Connections associated with their Organization
    - Edit any existing SAML Connections associated with their Organization
    - Reassign the primary SAML Connection associated with their Organization
    - Create a new SAML Connection associated with their Organization

You will immediately see any changes that the customer makes.
