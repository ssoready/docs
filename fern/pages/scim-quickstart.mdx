# Getting started with SSOReady SCIM

# Basic concepts

"Enterprise Directory Sync" is mostly a synonym for a protocol called
[SCIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_for_Cross-domain_Identity_Management).
It's a way for a company to sync their list of employees into a list of users
inside all their software products, including your product.

At smaller companies, it's typical to have someone use your product's equivalent
of "invite a teammate" to add users, and to manually kick them out when their
teammates leave the company. At larger companies, employees instead expect to
use a service like Okta or Microsoft Entra (formerly "Azure AD") to manage
adding and removing users. That user management happens using the SCIM protocol.
SSOReady makes it way easier to implement SCIM.

To implement SCIM, you need to run an HTTP server implementing the SCIM
protocol. When you use SSOReady, SSOReady runs that SCIM HTTP server for you.
Your only job then becomes to use SSOReady's SDKs or HTTP API to periodically
fetch a list of users to provision or deprovision in your product. Here's how
you do that.

# Code implementation

As covered in [Basic concepts](#basic-concepts), there's just one required step
in implementing SCIM: syncing users from SSOReady into your product. You can
optionally do the same with user groups. Here's how you do each.

## Syncing Users

Under the hood, SSOReady's SCIM server is basically just a database of users
that your customer populates. To sync users, you'll:

1. Paginate through a list of users
2. Either provision (create) or deprovision (delete or soft-delete, up to you)
   users based on their `deleted` attribute

### Listing users

To list SCIM users out of SSOReady, run:

```bash
curl 'https://api.ssoready.com/v1/scim/users?organization_external_id=...' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ssoready_sk_..."
```

That code sample requires an API Key (`ssoready_sk_...`) and an
`organization_external_id`. How you get those is covered in [Setting up
SSOReady](#setting-up-ssoready) later on this page.

You'll get back a response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "scim_user_...",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "deleted": false,
      "attributes": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "scim_user_...",
      "email": "bob@example.com",
      "deleted": true,
      "attributes": {}
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": "..."
}
```

If the response contains a `nextPageToken` whose value is empty (i.e. the empty
string, `""`), then you have reached the end of the list.

If `nextPageToken` is non-empty, there is more data to fetch. You can fetch the
next page of data by re-running your previous request, but setting the parameter
`pageToken` to the value of `nextPageToken` you just got back:

```bash
curl 'https://api.ssoready.com/v1/scim/users?organization_external_id=...&page_token=...' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ssoready_sk_..."
```

### Provisioning (creating) users

Every user you get back from SSOReady will look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "scim_user_...",
  "scimDirectoryId": "scim_directory_...",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "deleted": false, // if "true", go to "Deprovisioning (deleting) users" below
  "attributes": {
    // A JSON object of properties about this user. Exact schema depends on Identity Provider and your customer's setup.
  }
}
```

For every user you get back whose `deleted` value is `false`, you should create
a user in your system if one doesn't exist. You have two options for determining
if a SCIM user corresponds to an existing user in your system:

1. Do an `email`-based match.

   If you already uniquely identify users by their email, then you _must_ choose
   this option. Look up users by the `email` on the SCIM user. If you don't find
   any, create a new one with that email.

   Email-based matching is the option most folks go with.

2. Do a `scim_user_...` `id`-based match.

   SSOReady sets a unique identifier on every SCIM user. That ID is a UUID under
   the hood, and is guaranteed to be unique across all SCIM directories,
   organizations, environments, etc. It always starts with `scim_user_...`.

   If emails aren't a unique identifier in your product, then add a new
   attribute or database column on users in your system called
   `ssoready_scim_user_id`. When syncing in users for an organization, look for
   a user in that organization whose `ssoready_scim_user_id` equals the `id` of
   the SCIM user from SSOReady. If you can't find one, then create a new user
   whose `ssoready_scim_user_id` is the new SSOReady SCIM user's `id`.

Once you've created a new user from a SCIM sync, you can look at that user's
`attributes` to sync some further details about that user beyond their `email`.

#### User `attributes`

Identity providers can optionally include additional details about a user as
part of a SCIM sync. SSOReady recommends you ignore these additional details
unless you really need them.

A typical use-case for `attributes` is when applications have a hard requirement
on knowing a user's full name or first/last name. In that case, you will find
those properties, when they're available, within `attributes`. For example,
here's a typical set of attributes on a user synced from Okta:

```json
{
  "id": "scim_user_...",
  "scimDirectoryId": "scim_directory_...",
  "email": "ulysse.carion@ssoready.com",
  "deleted": false,
  "attributes": {
    "active": true,
    "displayName": "Ulysse Carion",
    "emails": [
      {
        "primary": true,
        "type": "work",
        "value": "ulysse.carion@ssoready.com"
      }
    ],
    "externalId": "00uhcdk08jtvkgwD95d7",
    "groups": [],
    "id": "scim_user_...",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "name": {
      "familyName": "Carion",
      "givenName": "Ulysse"
    },
    "userName": "ulysse.carion@ssoready.com"
  }
}
```

You can't guarantee that all identity providers will provide the same set of
attributes, or that they will all follow the same schema.

### Deprovisioning (deleting or soft-deleting) users

If a SCIM user you get back from SSOReady has `deleted` set to `true`, then that
user should no longer have access to your product. It's up to you whether you
want to "soft-delete" or "hard-delete" that user from your system. You should
determine which user in your system to delete using the same logic you use for
provisioning.

If you're not certain whether to soft- or hard-delete, the safer option is to
soft-delete.

Many products have to soft-delete for technical reasons; if you have database
foreign keys that point to users, you may find yourself unable to hard-delete
users without also deleting important business objects that other teammates may
need.

Whether you opt to soft- or hard-delete, SSOReady will retain the `deleted` copy
of the SCIM user indefinitely. You do not need to worry about SSOReady "expiring"
long-deleted SCIM users.

## Groups

<Note>
Unless you have a specific need for SCIM groups, you should defer implementing
them. Most of the time, syncing a [SCIM user attribute](#user-attributes) is a simpler solution.

SCIM groups are implemented inconsistently between different Identity Providers.
Some popular Identity Providers like Okta make them awkward for your customers
to use. You're typically better off waiting for a customer to come to you with a
specific use-case or requirement.

</Note>

SCIM natively has the concept of _groups_ of users. SSOReady lets you sync user
groups just like how you can sync users, as described above.

To sync groups, you'll:

1. Paginate through a list of groups
2. Either provision (create) or deprovision (delete or soft-delete, up to you)
   groups based on their `deleted` attribute
3. For each group, paginate through a list of users in that group
4. Add or remove users from that group based on whether they appear in the
   paginated list

Steps (1) and (2) are essentially identical to the logic for syncing users.
Steps (3) and (4) are about syncing group _memberships_, which is a
group-specific concept.

### Listing groups

To list SCIM groups out of SSOReady, run:

```bash
curl 'https://api.ssoready.com/v1/scim/groups?organization_external_id=...' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ssoready_sk_..."
```

You'll get back a response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "scimGroups": [
    {
      "id": "scim_group_...",
      "scimDirectoryId": "scim_directory_...",
      "displayName": "Engineering",
      "deleted": false,
      "attributes": {
        "displayName": "Engineering"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "scim_group_...",
      "scimDirectoryId": "scim_directory_...",
      "displayName": "Marketing",
      "deleted": true,
      "attributes": {
        "displayName": "Marketing"
      }
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": "..."
}
```

If the response contains a `nextPageToken` whose value is empty (i.e. the empty
string, `""`), then you have reached the end of the list.

If `nextPageToken` is non-empty, there is more data to fetch. You can fetch the
next page of data by re-running your previous request, but setting the parameter
`page_token` to the value of `nextPageToken` you just got back:

```bash
curl 'https://api.ssoready.com/v1/scim/groups?organization_external_id=...&page_token=...' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ssoready_sk_..."
```

### Provisioning (creating) groups

Every group you get back from SSOReady will look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "scim_group_...",
  "scimDirectoryId": "scim_directory_...",
  "displayName": "Engineering",
  "deleted": false, // if "true", go to "Deprovisioning (deleting) users" below
  "attributes": {
    // A JSON object of properties about this group. Exact schema depends on Identity Provider and your customer's setup.
  }
}
```

SSOReady sets a unique identifier on every SCIM group. That `id` is a UUID under
the hood, and is guaranteed to be unique across all SCIM directories,
organizations, environments, etc. It always starts with `scim_group_...`.

For every user you get back whose `deleted` value is `false`, you should create
a user in your system if one doesn't exist. You must match a SCIM group to a
group within your system using a new attribute or database column (e.g.
`ssoready_scim_group_id`) on your product's equivalent of a SCIM group.

When syncing in groups for an organization, look for a group in that organization
whose `ssoready_scim_group_id` equals the `id` of the SCIM group from SSOReady.
If you can't find one, then create a new group whose `ssoready_scim_group_id`
is the new SSOReady SCIM group's `id`.

As with users, SCIM groups may have additional optional attributes. The same set
of caveats applies to group attributes as to [user
attributes](#user-attributes): they aren't guaranteed to always be present or to
have the same schema across customers. In practice, most identity providers
don't put any interesting attributes on a group, and most SCIM implementations
don't care about SCIM group attributes at all.

### Deprovisioning (deleting or soft-deleting) groups

Deprovisioning groups is less important than [deprovisioning
users](#deprovisioning-deleting-or-soft-deleting-users). Not all identity
providers even support deprovisioning/deleting groups.

For that reason, SSOReady does not recommend you implement group deprovisioning
unless you have a specific use-case.

If you do need to implement it, group deprovisioning works a lot like user
deprovisioning. Match a SCIM group to your product's corresponding resource
using the same logic you use when provisioning groups. Then either soft- or
hard-delete the group.

Deprovisioning a group should not deprovision the users within that group. Users
may be part of multiple groups, and just because one of the groups they're a
part of has been deleted doesn't mean that user should be deleted too. If a user
needs to be deprovisioned in your system, their `deleted` property on the SCIM
user will always reflect that.

### Listing users in a group

To list users that are members of a group, you can provide a `scim_group_id`
parameter when listing SCIM users, using the same method as documented in
[Listing users](#listing-users) above:

```bash
curl 'https://api.ssoready.com/v1/scim/users?organization_external_id=...&scim_group_id=scim_group_...' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ssoready_sk_..."
```

You need to provide the SSOReady-assigned `id` for the SCIM Group, beginning
with `scim_group_...`, as the `scim_group_id`.

This will return a list of users in the same format as when listing users
without `scim_group_id` provided. Pagination works the same way as documented in
that section.

## Sync cadence

When you sync users (and optionally groups) from SSOReady into your product, you
have to decide on a frequency with which you will do so. SSOReady recommends two
options:

1. **Put your syncing code in a periodic background job, and run it every
   hour.**

   This is the preferred option. Write a cron job that goes through every
   organization in your product that may have SCIM enabled. Do a sync on each of
   those organizations. Run the cron job every hour.

   There's not much point in running the cron job faster than on an hourly
   basis; users and groups don't change _that_ often. Moreover, there's inherent
   limitations from the popular Identity Providers. Microsoft Entra, for
   example, only updates SCIM directories every 40 minutes.

2. **Give your users a "Force SCIM Sync" button in your app, and do a sync
   sychronously whenever they click that button.**

   Periodic background syncing is the way your customers will typically expect
   your SCIM implementation to work. But if setting up a periodic background job
   poses technical challenges, you can often get away with a more manual "force
   SCIM sync" approach to start.

   Give your users a button that, when clicked, does a sync for their
   organization. Typically, a SCIM directory only has few (less than a hundred)
   users, and so it's entirely feasible to sync all users within an HTTP request
   without timing out.

# Setting up SSOReady

Typically, most people implement SCIM after having set up SAML previously. If
that applies to you, and you implemented SAML using SSOReady, then jump straight
to [Creating SCIM directories](#creating-scim-directories).

In [Code implementation](#code-implementation), there were two missing pieces that you'd need to implement SSOReady:

1. **Where do I get an API key?** You create [an API key](#creating-api-keys) scoped to an environment.
2. **How do I get `organizationExternalId`?** You create [an organization](#creating-organizations) in an environment,
   where you can choose an external ID convenient for you.

This section will step you through how you'll do all of this setup in SSOReady's webapp. As a prerequisite step, you'll
need to [sign up to SSOReady](https://app.ssoready.com/login). It's free and anyone can sign up, even with a personal
email.

## Creating environments

To create an environment, go [here](https://app.ssoready.com/environments/new).
You'll typically create one environment per deployment environment, e.g. one
each for "production", "staging", and "local dev". On an environment, you'll
assign a "Redirect URL". That's a concept relevant only to SAML; if you don't
care about SAML at this time, just put any valid URL, such as
`http://localhost`.

## Creating API keys

API keys are scoped to an environment. When viewing an environment in the app,
click "API Keys" on the left navbar. Then click "Create API Key". A popup will
show you your new API key's secret (it starts with `ssoready_sk_...`). That's
the API key you'll use when [listing users](#listing-users) and optionally
[listing groups](#listing-groups).

## Creating organizations

An organization corresponds to a corporate customer of yours. If you sold your product to Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon,
you'd have three organizations in SSOReady: one each for Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon.

Organizations belong to an environment. When viewing an environment in the app, the "Create organization" button creates
a new organization. Organizations have two properties worth highlighting:

- An optional _external ID_, which you can assign. If you're selling
  multi-tenant B2B software, you probably already have a concept that closely
  matches an SSOReady organization -- usually, this is something named a "team",
  "workspace", "company", or something similar. When creating an SSOReady
  organization, use your product's counterpart to an organization ID as the
  external ID.

  You'll provide the external ID as the `organization_external_id` when [listing
  users](#listing-users) or [groups](#listing-groups).

- A set of _domains_. If you expect Apple's employees will log in to your
  product from `@apple.com` and `@shazam.com` email addresses, then put
  `apple.com` and `shazam.com` here. SSOReady will enforce that SCIM users come
  from these domains.

## Creating SCIM directories

A SCIM directory holds onto SCIM-related settings, and acts as a database of
users and groups synced from your customer's identity provider. When you [list
users](#listing-users) using SSOReady's API, you're listing out users from an
SSOReady SCIM directory.

SCIM directories belong to an organization. When viewing an organization in the
app, the "Create SCIM directory" button creates a new SCIM directory. Beyond the
SCIM-related settings covered in [Onboarding customers](#onboarding-customers),
SCIM directories have one setting of note: whether they are _primary_.

Each organization has up to one primary SCIM directory. In [Listing
users](#listing-users), you provide an `organization_external_id`. SSOReady will
use that organization's primary SCIM directory to list users from.

# Onboarding customers

In [Basic concepts](#basic-concepts), we mentioned that your customers need some
details from you before SCIM syncing can begin. This process happens offline --
there's no coding involved.

Unfortunately, SCIM identity providers (e.g. Okta, Microsoft Entra, etc.) don't
use the same terminology for these identical details. To deal with that, we've
prepared a separate set of documentation for you to follow depending on what
identity provider your customer uses:

- [Okta](/docs/idp-configuration/guides-for-common-identity-providers/okta)
- [Microsoft Entra](/docs/idp-configuration/guides-for-common-identity-providers/entra-formerly-azure-ad) (aka Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Azure AD)

In all cases, you're ultimately going to:

1. Give your customers a "SCIM URL". SSOReady's webapp gives you this.
2. Generate a SCIM bearer token, and give that to your customer. SSOReady's
   webapp lets you generate these, or rotate them if your customer needs a new
   one.

Once you've given those details to your customer, you'll be ready to start
syncing SCIM users!
