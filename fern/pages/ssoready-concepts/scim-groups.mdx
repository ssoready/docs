A SCIM group is a group your customer's identity provider provisioned in a [SCIM
directory](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-directories). For guidance on how you
should sync SCIM groups into your application, see ["Syncing
Groups"](/docs/scim/scim-quickstart#syncing-groups) in the SCIM
quickstart guide.

<Note>
As noted in the SCIM quickstart: Unless you have a specific need for
SCIM groups, you should defer implementing them. Most of the time, syncing a
[SCIM user attribute](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-users#attributes) is a
simpler solution.

SCIM groups are implemented inconsistently between different Identity Providers.
Some popular Identity Providers like Okta make them awkward for your customers
to use. You're typically best off waiting for a customer to come to you with a
specific use-case or requirement before implementing group syncing.

</Note>

This document details how a SCIM groups appears in the SSOReady web application
that you as a developer use. This UI is meant to see that the SCIM sync is
working, and as a debugging aid. From your application, you can programmatically
get a SCIM group by ID using the [Get SCIM
Group](/docs/api-reference/scim/get-scim-group) API endpoint.

# Properties

## SCIM Group ID

Every SCIM group has an ID starting with `scim_group_...`, for example:

```
scim_group_1b480vb5wd27avbqunvl1sa1s
```

SCIM group IDs are universally unique.

## Display Name

Every SCIM group has a `displayName`, which is human-readable and assigned by
your customer.

## Deleted

When a SCIM provider deprovisions or deletes a SCIM group, they are not deleted
from SSOReady entirely. Instead, they are marked with `deleted` set to `true`.

Deleted groups appear in the list of SCIM groups just like any other SCIM groups
do. It is your responsibility to decide how to handle a `deleted` group.
SSOReady's recommendations on this are discussed in ["Deprovisioning (deleting
or soft-deleting)
groups"](/docs/scim/scim-quickstart#deprovisioning-deleting-or-soft-deleting-groups)
in the SCIM quickstart guide.

As noted in the SCIM quickstart guide, deprovisioning groups is less important
than [deprovisioning
users](/docs/scim/scim-quickstart#deprovisioning-deleting-or-soft-deleting-users).
Not all identity providers even support deprovisioning/deleting groups.

For that reason, SSOReady does not recommend you implement group deprovisioning
unless you have a specific use-case.

## Attributes

Identity providers may include arbitrary attributes on SCIM groups, and SSOReady
will store these as the `attributes` on the groups.

No two identity providers include the same set of `attributes`. Many customers
will configure their identity provider differently, and have different SCIM
group attributes. Don't expect consistency when relying on SCIM group
attributes, but they are all there if you need them.

<Note>
    Though SCIM group `attributes` may be inconsistent, you can always rely on a
    SCIM group `displayName` being present.
</Note>

## Users

From the SSOReady app, you can see a list of users within each group. A group
may have no users in it at all. A group may contain deprovisioned users.

From your application, you can get a list of users within an organization
programmatically by calling the [List SCIM Users endpoint with a `groupId`
parameter](/docs/api-reference/scim/list-scim-users#request.query.scimGroupId).
