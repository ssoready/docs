An organization corresponds to a corporate customer of yours. If you sold your
product to Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon,
you'd have three organizations in SSOReady: one each for Apple, Nvidia, and
Amazon.

Organizations belong to exactly one
[environment](/docs/ssoready-concepts/environments). You can have any number of
organizations in an environment.

Within organizations, you can have any number of [SAML
connections](#saml-connections) and [SCIM directories](#scim-directories).

# Properties

## Organization ID

Every organization has an ID starting with `org_...`, for example:

```
org_ac4vpckpze4ugjm70lzkmtwd2
```

Organization IDs are universally unique.

## Organization External ID

If you're selling multi-tenant B2B software, you probably already have a concept
that closely matches an SSOReady organization -- usually, this is something
named a "team", "workspace", "company", or something similar.

For your convenience, SSOReady lets you assign organizations with an
`organizationExternalId`. These external IDs are optional. They must be unique
within an environment.

These external IDs are a convenience feature: they save you from
having to add some sort of `ssoready_organization_id` property on your existing
equivalent of an SSOReady organization. Instead, you can call SSOReady using the
ID you have naturally on-hand as the `organizationExternalId` when using
[SAML](/docs//api-reference/saml/get-saml-redirect-url) or
[SCIM](/docs/api-reference/scim/list-scim-users) endpoints. When onboarding new
enterprise customers, you set your ID for that customer as the External ID
on the SSOReady organization.

## Domains

Every organization must include a whitelist of domains. If you expect Apple's
employees to log into your product with `@apple.com` and `@shazam.com` email
addresses, then set `apple.com` and `shazam.com` as the domains for Apple's
organization in SSOReady.

This whitelist of domains is used in two places:

* When processing SAML logins, [the SAML user's email address must be from the
whitelist](/docs/ssoready-concepts/saml-login-flows#email-outside-organization-domains).
* When provisioning SCIM users, [the SCIM user's email address must be from the
whitelist](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-users#email).

In both cases, this is a security mechanism. Although the SAML and SCIM
protocols ensure the authenticity of messages between the service provider (your
application, with SSOReady acting on your behalf) and the identity provider
(your customer's Okta/Google/Entra/etc.), neither protocol directly handles the
possibility of a malicious customer (or their disgruntled IT admin) attempting
to log in as a competitor within your product.

To shield you against such cross-tenant attacks, SSOReady requires a first line
of defense by whitelisting the domains you expect a customer to be using. You
are free to add additional controls, but for most applications this built-in
domain whitelisting is sufficient.

<Note>
    For an in-depth explainer on this type of attack, see the SSOReady blog post

    workspace"](https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/abraham-lincoln-and-the-malicious-saml-idp/).

## SAML Connections

Organizations have any number of [SAML
connections](/docs/ssoready-concepts/saml-connections) that belong to the
organization. You can create SAML connections in one of three ways:

1. By hand, using the SSOReady web application
2. By having your customers create them, using [customer self-serve setup](#customer-self-serve-setup)
3. Programmatically, using the [Management API](/docs/management-api)

## SCIM Directories

Organizations have any number of [SCIM
directories](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-directories) that belong to the
organization. You can create SCIM directories in one of three ways:

1. By hand, using the SSOReady web application
2. By having your customers create them, using [customer self-serve setup](#customer-self-serve-setup)
3. Programmatically, using the [Management API](/docs/management-api)

# Customer Self-Serve Setup

Once you've created an organization, you can give your customers one-time
self-serve setup links. Customers can visit these links to configure their SAML
connections and SCIM directories.

You can learn more about customer self-serve setup
[here](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers).
