description: 'Understanding SAML Connections in SSOReady'
---

SAML Connections store the information that SSOReady needs in order to connect your application with your customer's identity provider.

In order to create a SAML Connection, you first need to create an [Environment](environments) and an [Organization](organizations). Each SAML Connection belongs to exactly one Organization, which in turn belongs to exactly one Environment.

### What SAML Connections look like

Below, you'll find a GIF that shows a common flow users will follow:
<ol>
<li>Within an Organization, users press *Create SAML connection*</li>
<li>Users complete the *Service Provider Configuration* by copying data from SSOReady into the relevant identity provider (IDP)</li>
<li>Users complete the *Identity Provider Configuration* by copying data from the IDP into SSOReady</li>
</ol>

If you have not previously configured a SAML integration in SSOReady or a similar product before, you will likely need to reference one of our IDP configuration tutorials, e.g. for Okta [here](/docs/idp-configuration/okta) in order to complete a SAML Connection in SSOReady.

### SAML Connection IDs

When you create a SAML Connection, SSOReady assigns it a *SAML Connection ID*. You cannot change the SAML Connection ID. It always begins with the prefix `saml_conn_`, and it looks something like this: `saml_conn_4kw33v9xa98yi8yxxx6o10exy`. 

### Primary SAML Connections

Each SAML Connection has a boolean property called *Primary*. This helps the SSOReady API resolve ambiguity when an Organization has more than one SAML Connection. 

Organizations may have multiple SAML Connections for any number of reasons. For example, you might find that your customer has two divisions -- one that uses Entra and another that uses PingOne. In this case, you would create one connection for Entra and another for PingOne.

Note in the [API reference documentation](/docs/api-reference/saml/redeem-saml-access-code) that SSOReady does not require you to identify a SAML Connection directly. Instead, you can identify an Organization, and SSOReady will infer the associated SAML Connection.

In cases where you pass SSOReady an Organization's ID *and* the Organization has multiple SAML Connections, SSOReady will default to the primary SAML Connection. To use any SAML Connection other than the Organization's primary SAML Connection, you will need to specify its SAML Connection ID in your API call.

SSOReady does not currently use this boolean property for any other purpose.

### SAML Connections and Login Flows

Every time one of your users attempts to log in via SAML, SSOReady creates a Login Flow, which it associates with the appropriate SAML Connection. You can read more about Login Flows [here](login-flows).
