SAML Connections store the information that SSOReady needs in order to connect your application with your customer's identity provider.

In order to create a SAML Connection, you first need to create an [Environment](environments) and an [Organization](organizations). Each SAML Connection belongs to exactly one Organization, which in turn belongs to exactly one Environment.

### SAML Connection IDs

When you create a SAML Connection, SSOReady assigns it a *SAML Connection ID*. You cannot change the SAML Connection ID. It always begins with the prefix `saml_conn_`, and it looks something like this: `saml_conn_4kw33v9xa98yi8yxxx6o10exy`. 

### Primary SAML Connections

Each SAML Connection has a boolean property called *Primary*. This helps the SSOReady API resolve ambiguity when an Organization has more than one SAML Connection. 

Note in the [API reference documentation](/docs/api-reference/saml/redeem-saml-access-code) that SSOReady does not require you to identify a SAML Connection directly. Instead, you can identify an Organization, and SSOReady will infer the associated SAML Connection.

In cases where you pass SSOReady an Organization's ID *and* the Organization has multiple SAML Connections, SSOReady will use the primary SAML Connection. 

SSOReady does not currently use this boolean property for any other purpose.

### SAML Connections and Login Flows

Every time one of your users attempts to log in via SAML, SSOReady creates a Login Flow, which it associates with the appropriate SAML Connection. You can read more about Login Flows [here](login-flows).
