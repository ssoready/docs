### Structuring SSOReady Environments

SSOReady *Environments* help you use our services in different applications or with different settings -- without requiring you to switch accounts.

You should map SSOReady Environments onto your own deployment environments. More concretely, we recommend that you maintain three Environments in SSOReady:
<ul>
<li>Local development</li>
<li>Staging</li>
<li>Production</li>
</ul>

You can deviate from this structure if doing so suits your needs.

If you're unsure how you want to use SSOReady Environments, feel welcome to reach out at contact@ssoready.com, and we'll be happy to help. 

### What SSOReady Environments look like

Below, you'll find a GIF that shows a common flow users will follow:
<ol>
<li>Users see active Environments at [app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com/)</li>
<li>Users create new Environments by pressing *Create environment*</li>
<li>Users enter a *Display name* and a *Redirect URL* for the environment</li>
</ol>

### Properties of SSOReady environments

#### Descriptive properties

Each Environment has a unique identifier. We call this an *Environment ID*. Environment IDs always begin with the same `env_` prefix. They look like this: `env_dwsxxx0cav2ku5j0uvlazwois`.

For each Environment that you create, you will also choose a *Display Name*, which is just a text field. We recommend that you name each SSOReady Environment for its associated deployment environment (e.g. calling the production environment in SSOReady "Production.")

#### Environments' redirect URLs

When you create an Environment in SSOReady, we'll ask you to provide a *Redirect URL*. The placeholder text will look something like `http://localhost:8080/ssoready/callback`.

For the purposes of understanding this Redirect URL, it's helpful to back up a bit. 

You will need two endpoints to process SAML logins with SSOReady:
<ul>
<li>One to send your user to an IDP like Okta, Entra, OneLogin, etc.</li>
<li>Another to receive data and execute the logic for a successful login.</li>
</ul>

The Redirect URL is the **second** of these endpoints. When SSOReady learns that one of your users is trying to log in with SAML, it needs to know where in your application to send the user. 

You should set up a distinct callback endpoint for each Environment. Your local development application should likely use something like `http://localhost:8080/ssoready/callback`. Your production application might have a Redirect URL that looks like `https://app.yourapp.com/ssoready/callback`.

You can change this later.

#### API keys and environments

SSOReady scopes each API key to a specific Environment.

You will need to create at least one API key for each Environment that you use. If you maintain local development, staging, and production Environments in SSOReady, you will need a local development API key, a staging API key, and a production API key. 

#### Organizations and environments

You will create *Organizations* within Environments. Each Organization will belong to exactly one Environment. You can read more about Organizations [here](organizations).

#### Using Environments in the SDKs

When you call our APIs, you don't need to use an Environment ID. We scope API keys to Environments, so if you're using a valid key, we'll know what Environment to use.
