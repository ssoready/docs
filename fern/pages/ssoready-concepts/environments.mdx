SSOReady environments hold onto top-level settings about your application, such
as [your app's URL](#redirect-url). They also serve as the parent resource for
[organizations](/docs/ssoready-concepts/organizations), which in turn hold onto
[SAML connections](/docs/ssoready-concepts/saml-connections) and [SCIM
directories](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-directories).

You should create one SSOReady environment per "deployment environment" your
application uses, e.g. one each for "production", "staging", and "local dev".

# Properties

## Environment ID

Every environment has an ID starting with `env_...`, for example:

```
env_579r04bhgwhl0zq7f3ynj8hh0
```

Environment IDs are universally unique.

## Display Name

You can assign your environments a human-friendly display name. SSOReady does
not show this to your customers. It is internal-only.

## Redirect URL

The redirect URL for an environment is where SSOReady will redirect your users
after they log in via SAML. This URL is also often called the "SSOReady callback
page".

For more details on what you should run on this page, see ["Handling SAML
Logins"](/docs/saml/saml-quickstart#handling-saml-logins) in the SAML
quickstart.

## OAuth Redirect URI

Optional. When using [SAML-over-OAuth (SAML NextAuth.js
integration)](/docs/saml-over-oauth-saml-nextauth-integration), this is the URL
SSOReady will redirect your users to.

If you aren't using SAML-over-OAuth, disregard this field.

## Custom SSOReady Auth URL

If you've enabled [Custom Domains](#custom-domains) on this environment, this is
the URL that your customers will see instead of `auth.ssoready.com`.

# Organizations

Environments contain any number of
[organizations](/docs/ssoready-concepts/organizations). You can create
organizations in one of two ways:

1. By hand, using the SSOReady web application
2. Programmatically, using the [Management API](/docs/management-api)

# API Keys

To implement SAML or SCIM, you need to call SSOReady's API from your application
using our SDKs or our HTTP API. To do that, you'll need an SSOReady API key.

SSOReady API keys are scoped to within an environment; you cannot create an API
key that can access multiple environments.

You can create API keys by going to "API Keys" on the side navigation, and
clicking the "Create API Key" button.

API Keys have two properties of note:

* An **API Key ID**, starting with `api_key_...`, is a non-sensitive identifier
that uniquely identifies an API key. It is not a secret.
* An **API Key Secret**, starting with `ssoready_sk_...`, is a secret. Do not
share it with others.

    When using SSOReady's SDKs, use the
`ssoready_sk_...` API key secret as the `SSOREADY_API_KEY` environment
variable.

    When using SSOReady's HTTP API, use the `ssoready_sk_...` API key secret as
    in an `Authorization: Bearer ssoready_sk_...` HTTP header.

Once you create an API key, you can only view the API key secret once. SSOReady
only stores the hash of the API key secret. If you've lost the API key secret,
or accidentally published it publicly, delete the API key and create a new one.

Deleting an API key also revokes the API key secret.

## Management API

All SSOReady API keys allow you to use the [SAML](/docs/saml/saml-quickstart)
and [SCIM](/docs/scim/scim-quickstart) APIs. This will allow you to implement
enterprise single sign-on and enterprise directory sync.

If you have so many enterprise customers that using SSOReady's web application
is unacceptable, SSOReady also supports a Management API.

API keys with Management API access enabled can programmatically manage (i.e.
create, list, get, and update)
[organizations](/docs/ssoready-concepts/organizations), [SAML
connections](/docs/ssoready-concepts/saml-connections), [SCIM
directories](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-directories), and [customer self-serve
links](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers)
within an organization.

For more details, see the [Management API documentation](/docs/management-api).

# Custom Domains

[SAML connections](/docs/ssoready-concepts/saml-connections) and [SCIM
directories](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-directories) both require that your
customers configure certain URLs that point at your application. Those URLs need
to be endpoints implementing the SAML and SCIM protocols.

When you use SSOReady, SSOReady runs those endpoints on your behalf. By default,
those endpoints have `auth.ssoready.com` in their names, because that's the
hostname where SSOReady runs endpoints on your behalf. For example, [SAML ACS
URLs](/docs/ssoready-concepts/saml-connections#assertion-consumer-service-acs-url)
and [SCIM Base URLs](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-directories#scim-base-url)
both contain `auth.ssoready.com` by default.

You can also run your SSOReady instance on a custom domain you control, such as
`auth.yourcompany.com`. When
running SSOReady on a custom domain, your customers see your custom domain
instead of `auth.ssoready.com` in their setup instructions.

To set up a custom domain, you'll need to have control over the DNS settings for
that domain. The SSOReady web application will ask you to create a custom CNAME
record pointing at an SSOReady-controlled domain. We require you to create a
custom CNAME before you can enable a custom domain for two reasons:

1. So that traffic your customers send to your custom `auth.ssoready.com` domain
will still be served by SSOReady, and
2. SSOReady needs to provision a TLS certificate for your custom domain, because
communication with `auth.ssoready.com` (or its custom domain aliases) must be
done over HTTPS. We can only do this if we first demonstrate that your custom
domain CNAMEs requests to a domain we control.

Adding a custom domain does not break any existing SAML connections or SCIM
directories. Existing SAML connections and SCIM directories will continue to use
`auth.ssoready.com`, but all new SAML connections or SCIM directories will use
your custom domain.

Adding a custom domain does not change the API calls you make to SSOReady. You
do not need to change any code, such as any code that calls [Get SAML Redirect
URL](/docs/api-reference/saml/get-saml-redirect-url) and [Redeem SAML Access
Code](/docs/api-reference/saml/redeem-saml-access-code). Regardless of whether
you use a custom domain, your backend's API calls to SSOReady will be directed at
`api.ssoready.com`.

# Custom Branding

SAML and SCIM are both designed such that they require setup on you and your
customer's end before they can work. To do that setup, you need to give your
customer specific instructions, tailored to the identity provider they use.

SSOReady can host a [self-serve SAML/SCIM setup
UI](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers)
on your behalf. To make that setup UI feel on-brand for your product, you can
customize:

1. Your company's name and logo, which appear in the navigation bar
2. A *return URL*, which points to your application. If you configure a return
URL, the self-serve setup UI will have a "Back to \[your company name\]" link in
the navigation bar, which takes users back to your application.

When you configure custom branding settings, the SSOReady web application will
show you a preview of what your users will see.
