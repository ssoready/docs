SSOReady is a free, MIT-licensed way to add SAML and SCIM support to your app. A free hosted version of SSOReady is available
online at [app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com). This article explains how to run SSOReady on your own machines,
instead of using the public, free version of SSOReady at [app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com).

<Tip>
    This article focuses on running SSOReady in your own cloud. You can also run SSOReady in your customer's cloud, so that
    SSOReady becomes a component of your larger on-premises offering to your customers; the only difference is that you'll
    need to follow these instructions for each customer.
</Tip>

# SSOReady Components

<Frame caption="Diagram of components involved in an SSOReady deployment">
    <img src="self-hosting-diagram.svg" />
</Frame>

SSOReady requires four essential components:

* `ssoready-app` is the webapp for SSOReady. In the free hosted version, this lives at https://app.ssoready.com.
* `ssoready-api` is what `ssoready-app` and your code (either directly, or using the SSOReady SDKs) talks to. In the free hosted version, this lives at https://api.ssoready.com.
* `ssoready-auth` is proxy for SAML and SCIM interactions. In the free hosted version, this lives at https://auth.ssoready.com.
* `ssoready-db` is a PostgreSQL database that `ssoready-api` and `ssoready-auth` talk to. This is where SSOReady keeps state.

An additional fifth component is optional:

* `ssoready-admin` is the webapp that powers the [self-serve setup UI](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers). In the free hosted version, this lives at https://admin.ssoready.com.

To that end, SSOReady maintains four Docker containers you can use to self-host:

* `ssoready/ssoready-app` runs the webapp
* `ssoready/ssoready-api` runs the SSOReady API
* `ssoready/ssoready-auth` runs the public-facing SSOReady SAML and SCIM proxy
* `ssoready/ssoready-migrate` runs SSOReady's database migrations against a Postgres database
* `ssoready/ssoready-admin` runs the public-facing self-serve setup UI

# Example docker-compose setup

Here's an example of how you can self-host SSOReady using `docker compose`. You can copy-paste this into
`docker-compose.yml` and run `docker compose up` to test it yourself right now.

```yaml docker-compose.yml
version: "2.4"
services:
  # this is an example postgres-in-docker setup, but any postgres (even outside of docker) will work
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15.3
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "password"
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  ssoready-auth:
    image: ssoready/ssoready-auth:sha-18090f8
    environment:
      AUTH_SERVE_ADDR: ":80"

      # Have this point at ssoready-db. In this example, that's the `postgres` docker-compose service above.
      AUTH_DB: "postgres://postgres:password@postgres/postgres"

      # Have this point at where this service will be accessible from the public internet.
      AUTH_BASE_URL: "http://localhost:8080"

      # Have this point at where the ssoready-admin service will be accessible from the public internet, followed by "/test-mode".
      AUTH_DEFAULT_ADMIN_TEST_MODE_URL: "http://localhost:8083/test-mode"

      # See "SAML State Signing Key" below. For initial testing, this default value is fine.
      AUTH_SAML_STATE_SIGNING_KEY: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

  ssoready-api:
    image: ssoready/ssoready-api:sha-18090f8
    environment:
      API_SERVE_ADDR: ":80"

      # Have this point at ssoready-db. In this example, that's the `postgres` docker-compose service above.
      API_DB: "postgres://postgres:password@postgres/postgres"

      # Have this point at where the ssoready-auth service will be accessible from the public internet.
      API_DEFAULT_AUTH_URL: "http://localhost:8080"

      # (Optional -- skip if you're not using ssoready-admin)
      #
      # Have this point at where the ssoready-admin service will be accessible from the public internet, followed by "/setup".
      API_DEFAULT_ADMIN_SETUP_URL: "http://localhost:8083/setup"

      # See "Supporting Login Methods" below.
      API_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: "171906208332-m8dg2p6av2f0aa7lliaj6oo0grct57p1.apps.googleusercontent.com"

      # See "SAML State Signing Key" below. For initial testing, this default value is fine.
      API_SAML_STATE_SIGNING_KEY: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

      # This should be the s3 bucket used to store admin logos.
      API_ADMIN_LOGOS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: "s3-bucket-name"
    ports:
      - "8081:80"

  ssoready-app:
    image: ssoready/ssoready-app:sha-18090f8
    environment:
      APP_SERVE_PORT: "80"

      # Have this point at where the ssoready-app service will be accessible from the public internet.
      APP_APP_URL: "http://localhost:8082"

      # Have this point at where the ssoready-api service will be accessible from the public internet,
      APP_PUBLIC_API_URL: "http://localhost:8081"

      # Have this point at APP_PUBLIC_API_URL, followed by "/internal/connect".
      APP_API_URL: "http://localhost:8081/internal/connect"

      # See "Supporting Login Methods" below.
      APP_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: "171906208332-m8dg2p6av2f0aa7lliaj6oo0grct57p1.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    ports:
      - "8082:80"

  # Optional. If you don't need the self-serve setup UI for configuring SAML and
  # SCIM, you can skip ssoready-admin.
  ssoready-admin:
    image: ssoready/ssoready-admin:sha-18090f8
    environment:
      ADMIN_SERVE_PORT: "80"

      # Have this point at APP_PUBLIC_API_URL, followed by "/internal/connect".
      ADMIN_API_URL: "http://localhost:8081/internal/connect"
    ports:
      - "8083:80"
```

(The example above requires localhost ports 5432, 8080, 8081, 8082, and 8083.)

Now, you'll need to set up the database tables that SSOReady requires. Do so by running:

```bash
docker run --network=host ssoready/ssoready-migrate:sha-18090f8 -d 'postgres://postgres:password@localhost/postgres?sslmode=disable' up
```

From here, you can visit `localhost:8082`, log in via Google, and then start using SSOReady as usual. To use the
SSOReady SDKs with your locally-running instance of SSOReady, see ["Configuring SDKs to talk to self-hosted SSOReady
instances"](#configuring-sdks-to-talk-to-self-hosted-ssoready-instances) below.

# Putting it in production

The example setup above is meant for use in `localhost`. There are a few things you need to do to make it work in
production:

1. Configure a "SAML State Signing Key"
2. (Only required if you use [SAML-over-OAuth](/docs/saml-over-oauth-saml-nextauth-integration)) Configure an `id_token` signing key
3. Configure ways to log into `ssoready-app`

The sections below detail how you'll do this.

## SAML State Signing Key

In the example configuration above, `ssoready-auth` and `ssoready-api` both have a "SAML State Signing Key" set to all
zeroes. That's a value that's adequate for development, but in production you **must** use a random value. Generate this
random value by running:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

`ssoready-auth` and `ssoready-api` must use the same value for this secret. It is safe to rotate this value at any time
by using a new random, 64-digit hex number.

## `id_token` Signing Key

<Note>
    This section is only required if you use [SAML-over-OAuth](/docs/saml-over-oauth-saml-nextauth-integration).
</Note>

SSOReady's SAML-over-OAuth integration has `ssoready-auth` act as an OIDC-compliant server. Such servers need to issue
`id_token` values, which are RSA-signed JSON Web Tokens. `ssoready-auth` by default generates a new, random RSA keypair
to sign these `id_token` values. This default doesn't work well if you're running multiple `ssoready-auth` instances
behind a load balancer, or if `ssoready-auth` instances are frequently being recreated.

To configure an `id_token` signing key, generate a new base64-encoded RSA private key like so:

```bash
openssl genrsa 2048 | base64
```

And then update `ssoready-auth`'s `AUTH_OAUTH_ID_TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY` to be that value.

## Supporting Login Methods

To log into `ssoready-app`, you need to configure at least one of the following login methods:

* Log in with Google
* Email (aka "magic links")
* Log in with Microsoft

If you don't configure any of these, then there's no way to log into SSOReady. The simplest login method to add is
Google, followed by email, followed by Microsoft.

### Configuring log in with Google

To configure Google-based social logins into `ssoready-app`, you need to populate the following env vars:

* `APP_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `ssoready-app`
* `API_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `ssoready-api`

To do so, you need to create a Google OAuth client. Follow [Google's docs for creating an OAuth
client](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow). You'll want to configure the
same "Authorized Javascript origin" as the value you chose for `APP_APP_URL`. From there, the client ID (ending in
`apps.googleusercontent.com`) is the value you'll want to put in the two env vars.

### Configuring email-based logins

<Note>
    Configuring log in with email is optional. Most users only set up Google.
</Note>

To configure email-based logins into `ssoready-app`, you need to populate the following env vars:

* `API_RESEND_API_KEY` in `ssoready-api`
* `API_EMAIL_CHALLENGE_FROM` in `ssoready-api`
* `API_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENDPOINT` in `ssoready-api`

SSOReady uses [Resend](https://resend.com) to send transactional emails. Resend's free tier is more than enough here;
you will not need to pay for Resend. To get an API key, you will:

1. Sign up for Resend for free
2. [Configure a domain to send emails from](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction)
3. [Create an API key](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/api-keys/introduction). Make sure the API key has sending
privileges for your domain.

From there, configure:

* `API_RESEND_API_KEY` to be your Resend API key. It starts with `re_...`.
* `API_EMAIL_CHALLENGE_FROM` to be `noreply@DOMAIN`, where `DOMAIN` is the domain you configured in step (2) above.
* `API_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENDPOINT` to be the same value you chose for `APP_APP_URL` in `ssoready-app`, but followed by `/verify-email`.

### Configuring log in with Microsoft

<Note>
    Configuring log in with Microsoft is optional. Most users only set up Google.
</Note>

To configure Microsoft-based logins into `ssoready-app`, you need to populate the following env vars:

* `API_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `ssoready-api`
* `API_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in `ssoready-api`
* `API_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` in `ssoready-api`
* `APP_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `ssoready-app`
* `APP_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` in `ssoready-app`

Set `API_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` and `APP_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` to be the same value as `APP_APP_URL` in
`ssoready-app`, but followed by `/internal/microsoft-callback`.

To get the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` vars, you need to create a Microsoft OAuth client. Follow [Microsoft's docs
for creating an OAuth app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate).

* Choose "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts" for supported account types.
* Choose the "Web" platform type, and the redirect URL will be the same as the `REDIRECT_URI` env vars above.
* The app's "Application (Client) ID", a UUID, is what you use for `API_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `APP_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`.
* Create a "client secret" credential (Microsoft documents this [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=client-secret#add-credentials) under the "Add a client secret" tab). The secret's value is what you put in `API_MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Enabling the Management API

The [SSOReady Management API](/docs/management-api) lets you programmatically
automate everything that would otherwise require a human to click around in the
SSOReady web application. If you don't need the Management API, skip this
section.

To enable the Management API in a self-hosted instance of SSOReady, you must
first log into the SSOReady web application a first time. That will create a
`app_organizations` row in the SSOReady database, upon which you can enable the
Management API.

Once you have logged into SSOReady, you can next connect to your your SSOReady
database (using `psql` or any other tool you're comfortable with), and run:

```sql
update app_organizations set entitled_management_api = true where id = '...';
```

To determine the appropriate `id` to run in the SQL command above, you may run:

```sql
select * from app_organizations;
```

In the common case where nobody else has logged into the SSOReady web
application, there will only be one `app_organizations` row to choose from.

# Configuring SDKs to talk to self-hosted SSOReady instances

By default, the SSOReady SDKs expect to talk to `https://api.ssoready.com`. When you're running SSOReady self-hosted,
you need to point it to your own instance of `ssoready-api`. Here's how you do that, supposing your `ssoready-api` lives
at `localhost:8081` like in the example above:

<CodeBlocks>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript"
    import { SSOReadyClient } from "ssoready";

    const ssoready = new SSOReadyClient({
    // add this new `environment` parameter
    environment: "http://localhost:8081",
    apiKey: "ssoready_sk_...",
});
    ```

    ```python title="Python"
    from ssoready.client import SSOReady

    client = SSOReady(
    # add this new `base_url` parameter
    base_url="http://localhost:8081",
    api_key="ssoready_sk_..."
    )
    ```
</CodeBlocks>

# Running migrations on `ssoready-db`

SSOReady requires `ssoready-db` to be a Postgres database. The `ssoready/ssoready-migrate` docker image can take any
Postgres database, and set it up to have the database tables SSOReady requires. `ssoready-migrate` is idempotent; it is
safe to run it multiple times or at any time.

```bash
docker run --network=host ssoready/ssoready-migrate:main -d 'postgres://...' up
```

The `-d` (`--database-url`) parameter requires a `postgres://` URI, of the form:

```text
postgres://username:password@host:port/db_name
```
