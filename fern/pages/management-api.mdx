<Note>
    The management API is only available on the [Enterprise
    tier](https://ssoready.com/pricing) when using the SSOReady's cloud-hosted
    offering.

    If you're [self-hosting SSOReady](/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting-sso-ready),
    you can use the management API for free.
</Note>

SSOReady automates away everything most companies will ever need to support their
enterprise SAML and SCIM plans. With SSOReady's
[SAML](/docs/saml/saml-quickstart) and [SCIM](/docs/scim/scim-quickstart) APIs,
you have everything you typically need.

For most SSOReady users, the typical lifecycle of how you use SSOReady is:

1. You sign up for the product at [app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com)
(one-time, ~1 minute)
2. You create a small number (often just two -- dev and prod) of
[environments](/docs/ssoready-concepts/environments) (one-time, ~5 minutes)
3. You implement SAML / SCIM by following the [SAML
quickstart](/docs/saml/saml-quickstart) or [SCIM
quickstart](/docs/scim/scim-quickstart) (one-time, ~1 day)
4. Every time you onboard a new enterprise customer, you (or your colleague, including nontechnical colleagues):
    * Create a new [organization](/docs/ssoready-concepts/organizations) for that customer (~5 minutes), and
    * You give the customer a [self-serve setup
link](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers),
and the customer sets up their SAML and SCIM configuration (~1 minute for you, ~5 minutes for the customer)

For some large-scale SSOReady users, step (4) is a problem, and they want to automate it. If you
have so many enterprises signing up that having to log into the SSOReady webapp to create an
organization for each of them is a concern, then you may be one such SSOReady user.

With the Management API, you can automate away everything that would otherwise
require a human to click around in the SSOReady web application. With the
management API, the workflow for steps (4) would become:

* You programmatically create an organization using the [Create
Organization](/docs/api-reference/management/organizations/create-organization)
endpoint.
* You programmatically create a self-serve setup link using the
[Create Setup URL](/docs/api-reference/management/setup-urls/create-setup-url)
endpoint, and present that URL to your customer in your UI.

# Management API Capabilities

The Management API can automate almost all operations that you can achieve by
clicking around in the SSOReady web application. In particular, you can:

    * [Get Organization](/docs/api-reference/management/organizations/get-organization)
    * [Update Organization](/docs/api-reference/management/organizations/update-organization)
* Manage [Self-Serve Setup URLs](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers):
    * [Create Setup URL](/docs/api-reference/management/setup-urls/create-setup-url)
* Manage [SAML Connections](/docs/ssoready-concepts/saml-connections):
    * [List SAML Connections](/docs/api-reference/management/saml-connections/list-saml-connections)
    * [Create SAML Connection](/docs/api-reference/management/saml-connections/create-saml-connection)
    * [Get SAML Connection](/docs/api-reference/management/saml-connections/get-saml-connection)
    * [Update SAML Connection](/docs/api-reference/management/saml-connections/update-saml-connection)
* Manage [SCIM Directories](/docs/ssoready-concepts/scim-directories):
  * [List SCIM Directories](/docs/api-reference/management/scim-directories/list-scim-directories)
  * [Create SCIM Directory](/docs/api-reference/management/scim-directories/create-scim-directory)
  * [Get SCIM Directory](/docs/api-reference/management/scim-directories/get-scim-directory)
  * [Update SCIM Directory](/docs/api-reference/management/scim-directories/update-scim-directory)

# Using the Management API

You can call the Management API using SSOReady's HTTP API, or using SSOReady's
SDKs. Each endpoint's API Reference listed in [Management API
Capabilities](#management-api-capabilities) includes examples using the SDKs
or HTTP API.

You can use the Management API using the same API keys you use when interacting
with the SSOReady SAML and SCIM APIs. By default, API keys do not have access to
the Management API. Creating API keys having access to the Management API is
covered in [SSOReady concepts: Environments: "Management API"](/docs/ssoready-concepts/environments#management-api).
