{/* ==================================================== */}

As a first step, you need to create an *Application* in Okta. The Okta *Application* will mediate all login interactions with SSOReady. Once you've finished setting it up, your users may see it as a tile in their Okta accounts.

Once you've successfully created an *Application*, you'll swap details between SSOReady and Okta to enable single sign-on.
<Steps>
### Create an application in Okta

To create an *Application* in Okta, you'll need your customer's Okta administrator to select *Applications* > *Applications* in the left nav panel.

<Frame caption="Selecting Applications > Applications from the left navigation panel">

</Frame>

You'll land on a page with a bold **Applications** header. Right under the header, select the dark blue button that reads *Create App Integration*.

Okta will flash a model offering you several radio button choices. Of these, select *SAML 2.0* and then press *Next* in the lower right corner.

</Frame>

Once you've selected *SAML 2.0*, Okta will change the header to read *Create SAML Integration* as below. Okta requires a display name. Write your product's name.

The remaining options on this page aren't especially important; select *Next* here, which finalizes creation of an Okta *Application*.

### Configure SAML Connection | Enter SSOReady details in Okta

Hitting *Next* on the prior page will have nudged you into a new tab, marked *Configure SAML*. Here, you'll start copy two pieces of data from SSOReady into Okta. 

At the top of the page, Okta asks for a *Single sign-on URL*. You will find this URL in SSOReady on the detail page for your SAML Connection. SSOReady calls it the *Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL*. It ends in `/acs`. Copy this *Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL* and paste it where Okta has written *Single sign-on URL*.

<Frame caption="Pasting the  ACS URL from SSOReady into Okta's Single sign-on URL field">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/okta/okta5.png" />
</Frame>

From here, proceed to the next field on the same page. It reads *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)*. SSOReady calls this the *SP Entity ID*. You'll find it directly under the *Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL* in the SSOReady app. It usually looks just like the ACS URL, except it does not end in `/acs`. 

Paste the *SP Entity ID* URL from SSOReady into Okta's *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)* field.

</Frame>

Once you've filled the *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)* field (and scrolled down to hit *Next* in the lower right corner), you've completed all the necessary data entry from SSOReady into Okta.


### Configure SAML Connection | Enter Okta details in SSOReady

Okta requires one brief detour wherein we supply feedback to their team. 

Select *I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app*, skip the remaining questions, scroll down, and press *Finish* in the lower right corner. 

{/* ====================================================

*/}

</Frame>

Now you can enter Okta data into SSOReady. The previous step will have routed you to a page with your application's name at the top. 

From here, scroll down a bit and hit *More details*. It's not always easy to see. 

<Frame caption="Scrolling down to find the 'More details' option for the SAML application">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/okta/okta9b.png" />
</Frame>

Once you've expanded the details for the SAML application, you'll see a bunch of data. 

Directly under the *More details* button, there's a URL marked *Sign on URL* with a light purple *Copy* button. SSOReady calls this the *Redirect URL*. Copy this URL and paste it into SSOReady as the *Redirect URL*.

{/* ====================================================
<Frame caption="Placeholder caption">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/okta/okta9.png" />
</Frame>
*/}


<Frame caption="Copying Okta's 'Sign on URL'; this will be the Redirect URL in SSOReady">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/okta/okta10.png" />
</Frame>

Scrolling further down, you'll see a similar line for a URL that Okta labels *Issuer*. SSOReady calls this the *IDP Entity ID*. Copy this *Issuer* URL and paste it in SSOReady as the *IDP Entity ID* in SSOReady.
<Frame caption="Copying Okta's 'Issuer' URL; this will be the IDP Entity ID in SSOReady">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/okta/okta11.png" />
</Frame>

Finally, SSOReady requires a Certificate. You'll find this further down on the same page in Okta. Okta labels it the *Signing Certificate.* (Please be aware that Okta has several related buttons that will not give you what SSOReady needs.) Press the rectangular *Download* button, which will download an `okta.cert` file. 

Upload `okta.cert` to SSOReady as the Certificate for this SAML Connection.

 Once you've uploaded the Certificate, we're all set! You've finished the SAML configuration. It's important to remember, though, that your customer's Okta administrator will still have to assign users to your application before they can sign in.
