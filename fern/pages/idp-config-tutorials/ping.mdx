### Creating an application in PingOne

We'll start our PingOne setup from your customer's administrator home page. Exactly how this looks will vary. Our example uses a newly provisioned account and therefore shows an onboarding guide; your customers' admin pages will look different in most cases.

Nonetheless, we'll always start by hitting *Applications* > *Applications* in the left navigation bar. This will take us to a new page.

<Frame caption="Navigating to Applications > Applications in the left nav bar">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping0.png" />
</Frame>

Once we've navigated to Ping's *Applications* page, we'll want to press the circular blue button with a plus icon toward the top left. This will trigger a slideover.

<Frame caption="Pressing the plus icon to trigger Application creation in Ping">

</Frame>

Ping wants us to assign the Application an *Application Name*. Our choice of name has no impact on Ping's integration with SSOReady, but Ping will use the *Application Name* as your product's display name. We'll likely want the *Application Name* to match your product's name exactly.

<Frame caption="Entering an Application Name in Ping">

</Frame>

Then we need to tell Ping that our Application uses SAML. Click the card that reads *SAML Application*. You may notice that this changes the text on the blue button below from *Save* to *Configure*.

<Frame caption="Telling Ping we want a SAML Application">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping3.png" />
</Frame>

Here, simply select *Configure*. This finalizes creation of our SAML application and progresses us to the next step.

</Frame>

Next, we'll have to enter some details about SSOReady into Ping. 



### Configuring a SAML Connection | Entering SSOReady data in Ping Identity

We'll now wee a page with a *SAML Configuration* header. It will present three radio button options; of these, we'll select *Manually Enter*. Doing so will trigger two input forms below the radio buttons.

</Frame>

Ping Identity requires two pieces of information about the SAML Connection we'll establish with SSOReady. Let's start with the first one.

Ping first asks for *ACS URLs*. SSOReady provides exactly one of these. You'll find it on the detail page for your SAML Connection in the SSOReady web application. We've labeled it *Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL*. It always ends in `/acs`.

Copy the URL from SSOReady and paste it into Ping here.

</Frame>

We'll do something similar again for a field Ping calls *Entity ID*. In SSOReady, we call this an *SP Entity ID*. We can find it adjacent to the *Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL* in the SSOReady web application. One might notice it matches the *Assertion Consumer Service (URL)* exactly, except it lacks the `/acs` suffix. 

<Frame caption="Pasting SSOReady's 'SP Entity ID' in Ping as the 'Entity ID'">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping7.png" />
</Frame>

We'll then simply hit *Save* toward the bottom of the page, concluding our entry of information about SSOReady into Ping. 

<Frame caption="Hitting 'Save' to finish our set-up">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping8.png" />
</Frame>



### Configuring a SAML Connection | Entering Ping Identity data into SSOReady

Just as we entered information about SSOReady into Ping, so too will we need to enter information about Ping into SSOReady. 

To start, let's make sure we find ourselves on the *Configure* tab. In a moment, we'll pull three pieces of information from this tab.

<Frame caption="Confirming that we're on the 'Configure' tab in Ping">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping9.png" />
</Frame>

SSOReady requires a *Certificate* from Ping. You'll find the appropriate uploader on the SAML Connection detail page in your SSOReady web application. 

We'll find this by clicking the *Download Signing Certificate* button and selecting *X509 PEM (.crt)* from the menu. 

We'll see a `.crt` file begin to download. The file may have a long and non-descriptive name; that is normal. 

We'll then upload the file to SSOReady as-is, which allows us to move to the next step.

<Frame caption="Finding the 'Certificate' in Ping">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping10.png" />
</Frame>

After we've taken care of the Certificate, we'll need a field that SSOReady calls an *IDP Entity ID*. It's an input field on the same card as the Certificate uploader.

Ping calls this information an *Issuer ID* and places it directly under the *Download Signing Certificate* from our previous step. 

We'll simply copy this URL from Ping and paste it into SSOReady as the *IDP Entity ID*.

<Frame caption="Copying the 'Issuer ID' from Ping Identity">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping11.png" />
</Frame>

Finally, we'll find a field that Ping calls the *Single Signon Service*. In SSOReady, we call this a *Redirect URL*. Just as we did before, we'll copy the *Single Sign On Service* URL and paste it into SSOReady as the *Redirect URL*.

<Frame caption="Copying the 'Single Signon Service URL from Ping Identity">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping12.png" />
</Frame>

Once we've copied over the *Single Signon Service* URL, we're done swapping information between SSOReady and Ping Identity, which means we're almost finished with set-up altogether. 

We'll now navigate to the *Attribute Mappings* tab to adjust one final setting in Ping. 

<Frame caption="Navigating to the 'Attribute Mappings' tab'">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping13.png" />
</Frame>


### Configuring a SAML Connection | Adjusting Ping attribute mappings

Here, we'll see three headers: *Attributes*, *PingOne Mappings*, and *Required*. Where we see *saml_subject* under *Attributes*, change the corresponding *PingOne Mappings* field. This will trigger a dropdown selector. We want this field set to *Email Address*. 

<Frame caption="Adjusting the 'saml_subject' in Ping">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping14.png" />
</Frame>

Finally, we'll hit *Save* at the bottom of the page. 

<Frame caption="Hitting 'Save' to finish our set-up">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping15.png" />
</Frame>

In the top right, we'll change the toggle from *off* to *on*. 

We're all done! 

<Frame caption="Turning the application on">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-assets/ping/ping16.png" />
</Frame>

Please do bear in mind, however, that your customer's Ping admin will still need to assign users to this application before they can sign in. This requires no action from you as a service provider.
