[SCIM](https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/what-a-developer-needs-to-know-about-scim/) (the system for cross-domain identity management) allows your application to synchronize its *users* data based on recurring communication with your customers' identity providers (IDPs). 

Your app will periodically listen for updates from your customer regarding the users that should have access to your application. You can use this information to provision or deprovision users -- or simply update data about a user (e.g., a first name).

SSOReady helps you use SCIM without integrating your product directly with Entra. You will instead integrate with SSOReady, which will communicate with Entra on your behalf.

<Warning>Entra's SCIM implementation has many unresolved issues. (See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-config-problem-scim-compatibility) for a known subset.) In rare cases, Entra's unusual behavior may result in an unsuccessful integration. Please contact us at support@ssoready.com if you encounter unexpected behavior. </ Warning>

Connecting SSOReady to your customer's Entra implementation requires that you share two pieces of information with Entra. You will find both of these in SSOReady:
1. A **base url** that Entra will perform operations on (e.g. via HTTP PATCH)
2. A **bearer token** that Okta will include with its requests

When Entra has both of those pieces of information, the connection between SSOReady and Entra is complete. No additional configuration within SSOReady will be necessary. With that said, configuration within Entra can be somewhat involved. 

This guide therefore starts by focusing *briefly* on SSOReady and subsequently focuses on Entra configuration.

# Configuring SSOReady

To create a SCIM Directory within SSOReady, you'll first need to create an [Environment](/docs/sso-ready-concepts/environments) and an [Organization](/docs/sso-ready-concepts/organizations). SCIM Directories belong to Organizations. You can create a SCIM Directory for an Organization by navigating to the Organization in SSOReady and selecting *Create SCIM directory*. 
<Frame caption="Creating a SCIM Directory in SSOReady">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/okta/ssor2.png" />
</Frame>

From there, you can find the *base URL* and generate the *bearer token* that your customer needs.

SSOReady **does not store bearer tokens**. You will not be able to access the bearer token in SSOReady again. You may at any time, however, replace the existing bearer token with a new one. When you create a new bearer token, you simultaneously invalidate the previous bearer token.

<Frame caption="Capturing the base URL and bearer token from SSOReady">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/okta/ssor1.png" />
</Frame>

Once you have created a SCIM Directory in SSOReady and taken note of both the base URL and the bearer token, you have finished with SSOReady configuration.

# Configuring Entra

Once there's a SCIM Directory in SSOReady, you can connect that SCIM Directory to your customer's Entra instance.

<Info>
The following steps will be most relevant to IT administrators. However, SSOReady customers may find this section helpful either as a resource to share with their *own* customers or for development purposes.
</Info>

Start at the Entra home page. Navigate to *enterprise applications* in the navigation bar.

<Frame caption="Visiting *enterprise applications* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_0.png" />
</Frame>

You'll now see a list of applications. In this case, we have just one: *test_application*. Click the blue text to see more details about the application. 

<Info> If the relevant application does not exist, you may benefit from reading more about creating an enterprise application [here](/docs/idp-configuration/guides-for-common-identity-providers/entra-formerly-azure-ad/saml-with-entra). </Info>

<Frame caption="Visiting *enterprise applications* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_1.png" />
</Frame>

You'll see an *Overview* page. Click on the menu item labeled *Provisioning* on the left.

<Frame caption="Navigating to *Provisioning* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_2.png" />
</Frame>

This will take you to a new manu. Look toward the top/center of the page for a button with a plus icon labeled *New configuration*. Click this. 

<Frame caption="Selecting *New configuration* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_3.png" />
</Frame>

You'll land on a page with a few data input options. Start with the field labeled *Tenant URL*. This is what SSOReady calls a *Base URL*. It's just the location where Entra will send its SCIM communications. Copy this value from SSOReady and paste it here. 

It should look something like the below:

<Frame caption="Pasting SSOReady's *Base URL* as the *Tenant URL* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_4.png" />
</Frame>

Next, look at the field labeled *Secret token* directly below the *Tenant URL*. This is the other value that SSOReady provides: the *bearer token*. Paste this value from SSOReady into Entra as the *Secret token*. 

The *Secret token* is sensitive. Please treat it like a password. Do not share it.


<Frame caption="Pasting the *Secret token* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_5.png" />
</Frame>

In Entra, you need to click *Test connection* to move on. Click this button and wait a moment. 

<Frame caption="Clicking *Test connection* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_6.png" />
</Frame>

Once it's clickable, hit *Create* in the lower left. 

<Frame caption="Pressing the *Create* button in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_7.png" />
</Frame>

You'll land on a new page showing an overview of the Entra application. Find the *Users and groups* button in the left navbar and click it. 

<Frame caption="Visiting *Users and groups* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_8.png" />
</Frame>

We need to assign users and/or groups to the application. Start by clicking the *Add user/group* button toward the top/center of the page. It's marked with a plus icon.

<Frame caption="Hitting *Add user/group* in Entra">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_9.png" />
</Frame>

Exactly what you'll see might vary here, but you'll see a searchable list of users and/or groups. Decide which users should have access to the application, select each, and then press *Select* in the lower left.
<Frame caption="Selecting users and/or groups to add to the application">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_10.png" />
</Frame>

You'll see another menu. If you're content with your selection, press the *Assign* button in the lower left. Entra will now consider those users and/or groups to be *assigned* to the application. 

<Frame caption="Assigning a selection of users and/or groups to the application">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_11.png" />
</Frame>

Entra will not yet have begun SCIM provisioning. To get Entra to begin SCIM provisioning, press the *Overview* button in the left navbar.

<Frame caption="Returning to the application's *Overview* for the application">
  <img src="/docs/assets/idp-scim-assets/entra/image_12.png" />
</Frame>

Press the *Start provisioning* button. It has a play button icon -- kind of like you'd see on a remote control. 

Within a few moments, you'll see a pop-up in the top right. It will say *Provisioning is scheduled to start*.

This means that Entra has successfully begun its communications with SSOReady. Configuration is complete.

<Note>Please be aware that Entra can take a long time to sync changes into SSOReady. Although you *may* see changes take effect immediately, Entra often takes 40 minutes to propagate changes.</Note>
