You will likely want to test your SSOReady implementation before setting up any SAML Connections with your customers' IDPs.

If you have started to implement SAML SSO in the service of a specific customer, you may wish to test with that customer’s identity provider. If you have a preference for open source software, you may wish to test with Authentik or Keycloak. You can also set up SAML connections in Google Workspace, which may be convenient for some small teams (e.g. startups).

In general, however, we tend to recommend that developers sign up for a Jumpcloud trial. 

Jumpcloud has a smooth, self-service onboarding that will help you avoid wasting time on IDP configuration. We have experienced JumpCloud as the most user-friendly IDP of the ones we've tested. 

We formerly recommended Okta developer accounts, but Okta seems intent on focing developers to install Okta Verify on their mobile devices.

## Setting up a JumpCloud trial account
<Steps>
1. Visit [jumpcloud.com](https://jumpcloud.com).
2. Follow the *Get Started* call to action.
3. Fill out the lead generation form for the trial. This will feel like the kind of form that funnels you into a 30 minute meeting with a salesperson, but you **will** get access in a moment.
4. Verify your email. 
5. Now you’re in Jumpcloud. Don’t forget to provision some users!
