[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) has support for SAML. That support
works, and is secure. But many folks run into a few problems:

1. Firebase makes onboarding new customers is a manual process for you and your
customer. It's also confusing for you and your customer, because Firebase's docs
do not explain how to onboard customers at all.

   SAML intrinsically requires that you give your customer some SAML settings,
   and then they give you some settings. [Firebase's SAML
   docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/saml) don't at all explain
   where your customer is supposed to put the settings you give them. In fact,
   Firebase's docs don't even clarify that one of the settings -- "Your app's
   Entity ID" -- is something *you* need to assign. The docs make no mention of
   the "ACS URL" (which Firebase calls a "callback URL", a term your customers
   will not understand) at all -- a setting that SAML can never work without.

2. Relatedly, it's very confusing how to test or dogfood your SAML support.

3. Firebase does not support IDP-initiated SAML flows, which allow your
customers to log into your product directly from their identity provider. You'll
have to explain to your customer that the experience they're used to -- clicking
on your app from Okta's website to log into your product -- doesn't work.

You can use SSOReady to take away these problems -- you'll find this article
and the rest of our docs to be explicit, clear, and detailed. SSOReady's
[self-serve setup
UI](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers)
automates SAML onboarding for you, and gives your customers a best-in-class
experience. And SSOReady supports IDP-initiated flows out of the box.

SSOReady integrates into Firebase as a [custom OIDC
provider](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/openid-connect). You can add
SAML support to your Firebase application in an afternoon.

# Getting started with SSOReady

This guide will take you through:

1. [**Basic concepts.**](#basic-concepts) How Enterprise SSO / SAML works at a
high level, and how SSOReady will help you implement it in your Firebase
application.
2. [**Code implementation.**](#code-implementation) What you'll need to build,
and how to use SSOReady's Firebase integration.
3. [**Onboarding customers.**](#onboarding-customers) SAML requires both you and
your customer do setup. SSOReady automates your end of the equation, and this
section describes what instructions you'll give to your customers.

SSOReady is just an authentication middleware layer. SSOReady doesn't "own" your
users, and it doesn't require you to use any particular tech stack, although
this article assumes Firebase. That's on purpose -- it makes onboarding easier
for you, and it forces us to keep earning your business in the long run, because
churning is easier.

# Basic concepts

"Enterprise SSO" is mostly a synonym for a protocol called
[SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language). It's a way for a company to easily let their
employees log into all their software products, including your product.

At smaller companies, employees use username+password or "Log in with Google" to sign into your product. At
larger companies, employees instead expect to use services like Okta or Microsoft Entra (formerly "Azure AD") to do
sign-in. Those sign-ins happen using the SAML protocol. SSOReady makes it way easier to implement SAML. SSOReady's
OAuth-over-SAML functionality makes SAML fit into existing OAuth-based applications.

SAML logins have two steps:

1. You [**initiate a SAML login**](#initiating-saml-logins) by redirecting your
user to their corporate Okta/Google/Microsoft.
2. Their corporate Okta/Google/Microsoft redirects your user back to your
Firebase application. Firebase will handle logging your user in.

Before this can happen, you and your customer need to exchange settings about each other. This process is done offline;
you'll give your customer some settings that SSOReady provides for you, and you'll email your customer asking for some
settings in return which you'll input into SSOReady.

We'll cover how to do (1) and (2) in [Code implementation](#code-implementation). We'll cover the setup work you'll need
to do inside SSOReady's webapp in [Setting up SSOReady](#setting-up-ssoready). We'll cover the settings you'll give and
ask for in [Onboarding customers](#onboarding-customers).

# Code implementation

## Initiating SAML Logins

Under the hood, initiating SAML logins requires you to get your user's browser to perform an HTTP POST against their
corporate Okta/Google/Microsoft with a specific XML message. SSOReady's SAML-over-OAuth flow abstracts this away into a
normal OAuth "authorize" redirect endpoint.

To start a SAML login, redirect your users to this `/authorize` endpoint:

```text
https://auth.ssoready.com/v1/oauth/authorize?client_id=saml_oauth_client_...&organization_external_id=...
```

That URL requires an OAuth client ID (`saml_oauth_client_...`) and an `organization_external_id`. How you get those is
covered in [Setting up SSOReady](#setting-up-ssoready) later on this page.
