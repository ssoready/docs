[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) has support for SAML. That support
works, and is secure. But many folks run into a few problems:

1. Firebase makes onboarding new customers is a manual process for you and your
customer. It's also confusing for you and your customer, because Firebase's docs
do not explain how to onboard customers at all.

   SAML intrinsically requires that you give your customer some SAML settings,
   and then they give you some settings. [Firebase's SAML
   docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/saml) don't at all explain
   where your customer is supposed to put the settings you give them. In fact,
   Firebase's docs don't even clarify that one of the settings -- "Your app's
   Entity ID" -- is something *you* need to assign. The docs make no mention of
   the "ACS URL" (which Firebase calls a "callback URL", a term your customers
   will not understand) at all -- a setting that SAML can never work without.

2. Relatedly, it's very confusing how to test or dogfood your SAML support.

You can use SSOReady to take away these problems -- you'll find this article and
the rest of our docs to be explicit, clear, and detailed. SSOReady's [self-serve
setup
UI](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers)
automates SAML onboarding for you, and gives your customers a best-in-class
experience.

SSOReady integrates into Firebase as a [custom OIDC
provider](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/openid-connect). You can add
SAML support to your Firebase application in an afternoon.

# Getting started with SSOReady

This guide will take you through:

1. [**Basic concepts.**](#basic-concepts) How Enterprise SSO / SAML works at a
high level, and how SSOReady will help you implement it in your Firebase
application.
2. [**Code implementation.**](#code-implementation) What you'll need to build,
and how to use SSOReady's Firebase integration.
3. [**Onboarding customers.**](#onboarding-customers) SAML requires both you and
your customer do setup. SSOReady automates your end of the equation, and this
section describes what instructions you'll give to your customers.

SSOReady is just an authentication middleware layer. SSOReady doesn't "own" your
users, and it doesn't require you to use any particular tech stack, although
this article assumes Firebase. That's on purpose -- it makes onboarding easier
for you, and it forces us to keep earning your business in the long run, because
churning is easier.

# Basic concepts

"Enterprise SSO" is mostly a synonym for a protocol called
[SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language). It's a way for a company to easily let their
employees log into all their software products, including your product.

At smaller companies, employees use username+password or "Log in with Google" to
sign into your product. At larger companies, employees instead expect to use
services like Okta or Microsoft Entra (formerly "Azure AD") to do sign-in. Those
sign-ins happen using the SAML protocol.

SSOReady makes it way easier to implement SAML. SSOReady's OAuth-over-SAML
functionality makes SAML fit into existing OAuth-based applications, so you can
use SSOReady as a custom OIDC provider in your Firebase app. From your code's
perspective, SSOReady will seem like an ordinary custom OIDC provider. Under the
hood, and from your customer's perspective, it will actually be a SAML login,
with all the benefits that brings for your customer.

We'll cover how to create a custom Firebase OIDC provider in [Setting up
Firebase](#setting-up-firebase). We'll then see the code you need to write in
[Code implementation](#code-implementation). We'll cover the setup work you'll
need to do inside SSOReady's webapp in [Setting up
SSOReady](#setting-up-ssoready). We'll cover the settings you'll give and ask
for in [Onboarding customers](#onboarding-customers).

# Setting up Firebase

SSOReady can act as a Firebase OpenID Connect ("OIDC") provider. To set up
SSOReady's integration with Firebase, follow these steps:

<Steps>
    ### Create an SSOReady SAML OAuth Client

    <Tip>
        For more details on what you're setting up in this step, see [Creating
    environments](#creating-environments) and [Creating SAML OAuth
    Clients](#creating-saml-oauth-clients) in the [Setting up SSOReady
    section](#setting-up-ssoready).
    </Tip>

    [Sign up to SSOReady](https://app.ssoready.com/login), if you haven't
    already. It's free and anyone can sign up, even with a personal email.

    Create an [environment](/docs/ssoready-concepts/environments). You can do so
    directly from [this page](https://app.ssoready.com/environments/new). Choose
    any name you like, and choose any Redirect URL -- `http://localhost` is
    fine. Because we'll be using SAML-over-OAuth, this value won't be used.
    Leave OAuth Redirect URI blank -- we'll get its correct value from Firebase
    later.

    Create a SAML OAuth Client. You can do so by going to "API Keys" from the
    left sidebar, and then clicking on "Create SAML OAuth Client".

    A popup now appears. Click on the SAML OAuth Client secret to copy it. Paste
    that somewhere temporary, you'll need it in step (3). Click "Done". You're
    now viewing a SAML OAuth Client's details.

    We're done setting things up on the SSOReady side. Open a new tab, and go to
    Firebase.

    ### Go to your Firebase app's "Sign-in method" Settings

    Go to your Firebase application in the [Firebase
    console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), if you haven't already.

    You can find these settings by clicking on "Build" in the left sidebar, then
    Authentication. In the top navigation bar, go to the "Sign-in method" tab.

    ### Add a new OpenID Connect provider

    Click on "Add a new provider". Then click on "OpenID Connect". Then toggle
    "Enable" to be on. Configure the OIDC provider as follows:

    * **Grant type**: Keep this value as "Code flow", which is the default.

    * **Name**: We recommend "SSOReady SAML". The provider ID becomes
    `oidc.ssoready-saml`. If you choose a different name, you'll need to make
    sure that you adapt the code in [Code implementation](#code-implementation)
    to use your provider ID instead of `oidc.ssoready-saml`.

    * **Client ID**: In the SSOReady tab from step (1), you're looking at the
    SAML OAuth Client you created. Copy its ID -- it starts with
    `saml_oauth_client_...` -- into the Client ID in Firebase.

    * **Issuer URL**: Set this to `https://auth.ssoready.com/v1/oauth`.

    * **Client secret**: In step (1), you copied a SAML OAuth Client secret. Its
    value starts with `ssoready_oauth_client_secret_...`. Paste that into the
    Client secret in Firebase.

    Click "Next". Firebase now shows you a Callback URL -- it ends in
    `/__/auth/handler`. Copy that value, and then click "Save".

    ### Set the Firebase Callback URL as your SSOReady OAuth Redirect URI

    Go back to your SSOReady tab. Click on "Overview" in the left sidebar, and
    then click on "Edit" on the top right. Set the "OAuth Redirect URI" value to
    be the Callback URL you copied from Firebase in step (3). Then click "Save".
</Steps>

With that, both Firebase and SSOReady are configured. Your next step is to add a
bit of code to tell Firebase to do a SAML-based login using SSOReady.

# Code implementation

From here, you'll use [Firebase's sign-in
flows](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/openid-connect#handle_the_sign-in_flow_with_the_firebase_sdk)
for OIDC connectors. You'll want to use the "Pop-up flow", because [Firebase's
"redirect flow" doesn't work with modern
browsers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/redirect-best-practices).

You need to pass an `organizationExternalId` custom OAuth parameter. How you get
that value is covered in [Setting up SSOReady](#setting-up-ssoready) later on
this page.

Putting it all together, typically you'll write Firebase code that looks like
this:

```js
import { getAuth, signInWithPopup, OAuthProvider } from "firebase/auth";

const provider = new OAuthProvider("oidc.ssoready-saml");
provider.setCustomParameters({
  organizationExternalId: "..." // see "Setting up SSOReady" for what you put here
})

const auth = getAuth();
await signInWithPopup(auth, provider)
```

From here, SSOReady and Firebase will automatically integrate together to log
users into your system over SAML.

If you want to get the user's SAML email address, you can get that from the
current user like so:

```js
const auth = getAuth();
const samlEmail = auth.currentUser.providerData
    .find(({ providerId }) => providerId === "oidc.ssoready-saml")
    .uid
```

# Setting up SSOReady

[Setting up Firebase](#setting-up-firebase) breezed through creating something
called an "environment" and a "SAML OAuth Client". In [Code
implementation](#code-implementation), there was one missing detail
(`organizationExternalId`) that you need to implement SSOReady. This section
explains what's going on with those.

1. **What is an SSOReady environment?** An [environment](#creating-environments) is how you tell SSOReady where your Firebase app lives.
2. **What is an SSOReady SAML OAuth Client?** A [SAML OAuth Client](#creating-saml-oauth-clients) belongs to an environment. It's an adapter that makes SAML look like OAuth.
3. **How do I get `organizationExternalId`?** You create [an organization](#creating-organizations) in an environment,
where you can choose an external ID convenient for you.

This section will step you through how you'll do all of this setup in SSOReady's webapp. As a prerequisite step, you'll
need to [sign up to SSOReady](https://app.ssoready.com/login). It's free and anyone can sign up, even with a personal
email.

## Creating environments

<Tip>
    You can skip this step if you've already followed [Setting up
    Firebase](#create-an-ssoready-saml-oauth-client).
</Tip>

To create an environment, go [here](https://app.ssoready.com/environments/new).
You'll typically create one environment per Firebase project. Environments
require a "Redirect URL", but if you only ever use SAML-over-OAuth, its value is
never used. When you're integrating SSOReady with Firebase, what matters is the
environment's [OAuth Redirect
URI](/docs/ssoready-concepts/environments#oauth-redirect-uri).

Firebase calls the SSOReady OAuth Redirect URI a "callback URL". Its value
should be something like:

```text
https://your-firebase-project-name.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler
```

Set your environment's OAuth Redirect URI to the Firebase callback URL.

## Creating SAML OAuth clients

<Tip>
    You can skip this step if you've already followed [Setting up
    Firebase](#create-an-ssoready-saml-oauth-client).
</Tip>

SAML and OAuth are different protocols, but SSOReady's SAML OAuth Clients act as
bridge between the two. They look to the outside world like a normal OAuth
client, but under the hood they wrap SAML to carry out an OAuth flow.

SAML OAuth Clients are scoped to an environment. When viewing an environment in
the app, click "API Keys" on the left navbar. Then click "Create SAML OAuth
Client". A popup will show you your new SAML OAuth client's secret (it starts
with `ssoready_oauth_client_secret_...`). That's the "Client secret" you'll
[input into Firebase](#add-a-new-openid-connect-provider)

After clicking "View SAML OAuth Client" on that popup, you'll
also see the client's ID (it starts with `saml_oauth_client_...`). That's the
"Client ID" you'll input into Firebase.

## Creating organizations

An organization corresponds to a corporate customer of yours. If you sold your product to Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon,
you'd have three organizations in SSOReady: one each for Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon.

Organizations belong to an environment. When viewing an environment in the app, the "Create organization" button creates
a new organization. Organizations have two properties worth highlighting:

* An optional *external ID*, which you can assign. If you're selling multi-tenant B2B software, you probably already
have a concept that closely matches an SSOReady organization -- usually, this is something named a "team", "workspace",
"company", or something similar. When creating an SSOReady organization, use your product's counterpart to an
organization ID as the external ID.

  You'll provide the external ID as the `organizationExternalId` in your [code
implementation](#code-implementation).

* A set of *domains*. If you expect Apple's employees will log in to your product from `@apple.com` and `@shazam.com`
email addresses, then put `apple.com` and `shazam.com` here. SSOReady will enforce that users' SAML logins come from
these domains.

## Creating SAML connections

A SAML connection holds onto SAML-related settings. In ["Onboarding customers"](#onboarding-customers), you'll be
providing and asking for settings. Those settings all live on an SSOReady SAML connection.

SAML connections belong to an organization. When viewing an organization in the app, the "Create SAML connection" button
creates a new SAML connection. Beyond the SAML-related settings covered in ["Onboarding
customers"](#onboarding-customers), SAML connections have one setting of note: whether they are *primary*.

Each organization has up to one primary SAML connection. In your [code
implementation](#code-implementation), you provide an `organizationExternalId`.
SSOReady will use that organization's primary SAML connection to initiate the
login.

# Onboarding customers

In [Basic concepts](#basic-concepts), we mentioned that you and your customer
need to exchange details about each other
before you can do SAML logins. This process happens offline -- there's no coding
involved.

You have to go through this process each time a new company wants to set up
SAML. It's inherent to how SAML was designed.

With SSOReady, you have two options for onboarding customers onto SAML -- that
is, exchanging SAML-related settings with them. You can:

1. Use SSOReady's [self-serve setup
links](/docs/idp-configuration/enabling-self-service-configuration-for-your-customers).
You give your customers a link, where they can set up SAML on their own. It's a
slick experience for your customers, and they'll get set up in minutes. **We
recommend this approach.**
2. Give your customers instructions yourself, over email/slack/Zoom/etc.

If you go with option (2), be advised that SAML identity providers (e.g. Okta,
Microsoft Entra, Google Workspace, etc.) don't use the same
terminology for these identical details. To deal with that, we've prepared a
separate set of documentation for you to
follow depending on what identity provider your customer uses:

- [Okta](/docs/idp-configuration/guides-for-common-identity-providers/okta/saml-with-okta)
- [Google Workspace](/docs/idp-configuration/guides-for-common-identity-providers/google/saml-with-google)
- [Microsoft Entra](/docs/idp-configuration/guides-for-common-identity-providers/entra-formerly-azure-ad/saml-with-entra) (aka Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Azure AD)
- [JumpCloud](/docs/idp-configuration/guides-for-common-identity-providers/jumpcloud/saml-with-jumpcloud)
- [Ping Identity](/docs/idp-configuration/guides-for-common-identity-providers/ping-identity/saml-with-ping-identity)

In all cases, you're ultimately going to:

1. Give your customers an "SP Entity ID" and "SP ACS URL". SSOReady's webapp gives you both.
2. Ask your customers for an "IDP Entity ID", "IDP Redirect URL", and "IDP Certificate" which you input into SSOReady.

Once you have all those details, you'll be ready to accept SAML logins!
