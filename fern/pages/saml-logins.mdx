<Note>

This document contains best practices for SAML. You should start with the
[quickstart](/docs/saml/saml-quickstart) first.

</Note>

Implementing SAML has two major steps: starting a SAML login, and then handling
a SAML login. SSOReady documents best practices for starting SAML logins
[here](/docs/saml/integrating-saml-into-your-login-ui). This document is about
best practices for handling a SAML login.

Handling a SAML login is about doing two things:

1. SSOReady gives you the email and organization of the person logging in. You
   need to determine which user that corresponds to. This is called [_matching_ a
   user](#matching-users).
2. If no matching user exists, you need to decide what to do about that. This is
   called [_provisioning_ a user](#provisioning-users).

To frame this conversaion, let's start with a recap of SSOReady callback URLs,
which is where you'll implement all of this logic.

# Implementing your SSOReady callback URL

Handling a SAML login happens from your [SSOReady callback
URL](/docs/sso-ready-concepts/environments#environments-redirect-urls). This is
something you configured when you [implemented
SSOReady](/docs/saml/saml-quickstart). It's typically a URL like:

```
https://yourcompany.com/ssoready-callback
```

When one of your users has successfully logged in via SAML, SSOReady redirects
their browser to your SSOReady callback URL with a SAML access code, so you get
a request like this:

```
https://yourcompany.com/ssoready-callback?saml_access_code=saml_access_code_...
```

Your backend then exchanges that SAML access code for details about the user
logging in:

<CodeBlocks>

```bash title="cURL"
curl https://api.ssoready.com/v1/saml/redeem \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ssoready_sk_..." \
  -d '{ "samlAccessCode": "saml_access_code_..." }'
```

```typescript title="TypeScript"
const ssoready = new SSOReadyClient();
await ssoready.saml.redeemSamlAccessCode({
  samlAccessCode: "saml_access_code_...",
});
```

```python title="Python"
client = SSOReady()
client.saml.redeem_saml_access_code(
    saml_access_code="saml_access_code_...",
)
```

</CodeBlocks>

You'll get back details about user that look like this:

```json
{
  "email": "john.doe@acme.com",
  "organizationId": "org_7cu5hsy9vrbi5d2k1qvbh19lj",
  "organizationExternalId": "my_custom_external_id"
}
```

The rest of this document is about where you go from here.

# Matching users

Ultimately, handling a SAML login is just a question of giving back to the
browser a login session. You do this using whatever library you use for managing
user sessions.

To do that, you need to figure out which user to log the browser into. You need
to go from the details you got from SSOReady -- an `email` and an organization
-- to a user in your system. That's called _user matching_.

Usually, this just consists of finding a user by running a query like:

```sql
-- $1 is the `email` from SSOReady
-- $2 is the `organizationExternalId` from SSOReady

select id from users where email = $1 and organization_id = $2;
-- or, if you don't have organization_id on users
select id from users where email = $1;
```

From a security standpoint, you can rely on the fact that SSOReady has
authenticated that a SAML assertion with the given `email` came from one of the
[SAML connections](/docs/sso-ready-concepts/saml-connections) that the
[organization](/docs/sso-ready-concepts/organizations) trusts. You can also
count on the `email` coming from a domain that's in [the list of allowed
domains](/docs/sso-ready-concepts/organizations#organizations-and-their-domains)
for that organization.

# Provisioning users

The previous section was concerned with finding a user given their email and
organization. But sometimes, no matching user is found. In that case, you need
to think about whether/how you want to create, or _provision_, a user on the
spot.

The typical stages of maturity for implementing user provisioning with SAML are:

1. [No provisioning at all](#no-provisioning-at-all). If you can't find a
   matching user, you tell the user they need to first sign up by hand.
2. [Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning](#just-in-time-jit-provisioning). Create a
   brand new user and then immediately log them into that user.
3. [SCIM-based Provisioning](#scim-based-provisioning). You don't really worry
   about not finding a matching user, because you sync them into your system
   behind the scenes on a frequent periodic basis.

Most companies implementing SAML start at (1) or go straight to (2). You often
can't stay with option (1) for very long; it has some annoying downsides for
your customers. When your customers start asking for SCIM, you eventually go to
option (3) for those customers.

## No provisioning at all

The easiest way to implement SAML user provisioning is to not do it at all.

With this approach, you tell your customer that they can't log in with SAML
without first signing up with their email using a non-SAML-based signup method.

The problem with this approach is that it defeats a big part of the reason
customers want SAML to begin with. The main reason your customers want SAML is
that:

1. They want their employees to avoid having passwords for various products,
   including your product.
2. They want to easily enable access to your product for dozens of employees at
   a time, without having to do a bunch of training of their employees.

When you don't support provisioning, that means your customer's employees need
to all sign up manually. You'll find that:

1. You need to make sure you have some non-password-based login method
   supported. Usually the only workable option is here is an email
   magic-link-based login method. You'll find many companies consider these
   "insecure" or are just unfamiliar with them.
2. Many employees will be confused by this process, and will sign up with a
   password-based method anyway. Your customer's IT admin may want to do audits
   to make sure nobody did that, and will want those users' passwords
   deprovisioning.

Overall, this approach saves you a bit of initial implementation time, but it
doesn't tend to last for long.

For this reason, we recommend you strongly consider jumping straight to
[Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning](#just-in-time-jit-provisioning) when initially
implementing SAML. You can probably only get away with no provisioning at all
for your first, most patient, customers.

## Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning

Just-in-time provisioning refers to the idea of creating a brand-new user on the
spot when you don't find a matching user.

You implement JIT provisioning by:

1. Creating a new user in your database with the `email` you got from SSOReady
2. Making the user belong to the organization in `organizationExternalId` you
   got from SSOReady. This might be some `organization_id` column on your
   `users` table, some `users` list on organizations, an association table, etc.
   Just do whatever you normally do to tie users and organizations.

   If you decide which organization a user belongs to based on the domain of
   their email address, then you don't need to do anything here. [SSOReady
   enforces organization domains on your
   behalf](/docs/sso-ready-concepts/organizations#organizations-and-their-domains).

3. Create a new login session token/JWT/etc for that user however you normally
   do that.
4. Give that login session to the web browser, again using whatever method is
   normal or convenient for you.

Don't assign a password for this new user. Generally speaking, your customers
will prefer it if you can prevent JIT-provisioned users from supporting any
login method other than SAML. Your customers want to be able to shut off access
to your product by shutting off the relevant SAML user on their end.

Make sure that that your JIT provisioning logic is consistent with your matching
logic. You only want to create a new user the _first_ time they log in via SAML.
On all subsequent logins, your user matching logic should match with the user
you JIT-provisioned the first time.

## SCIM-based Provisioning

[SCIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_for_Cross-domain_Identity_Management)
("System for Cross-domain Identity Management") is a standardized way for your
customers to provision and deprovision users in your product offline.
[SSOReady's SCIM product](/docs/scim/scim-quickstart) gives you an easy, free,
and open-source way to add SCIM support to your product.

Usually, customers want SAML first, and later on start asking for SCIM. Since
SCIM is all about provisioning, you often find that SAML-based provisioning
stops being so important.

Typically, by the time you implement SCIM you've already implemented JIT SAML
provisioning. You can usually copy the code you wrote for SAML JIT provisioning
to implement SAML based provisioning.

But you'll usually find that many customers want and pay for your SAML support,
but don't need SCIM support. So you likely won't be able to immediately turn off
SAML user provisioning once you implement SCIM.

As a result, the typical path here is to just do nothing. Even once you've
shipped SCIM-based provisioning, just leave your SAML-based provisioning logic
as-is, since other customers still need it and it doesn't do any harm to your
SCIM-based customers.
